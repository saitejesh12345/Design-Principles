->Open close principle says that when you are creating a class it should be
open for extension and closed for modification.

->what it means is as a developer  should not be editing the existing code which is working in
production but if you want to add new functionality in your class you should
be able to add new functionality so your class should be closed for modification
but it should be open for extension.

->let's take a simple example to understand this principle so in our
mobile phone we have basic functionality that we can call to some other person we
can send messages we can take photos and etc etc so these are the basic functionality
which will be available in each of these mobile phone so all these
functionality the mobile provided like Google or Apple they have closed these
basic functionality for modification so those basic functionalities are closed
for modification.

->but in these mobile.phone we have apple store or Play Store in Google phones through which users can
download extra features extra functionalities like you can go ahead
and download some games which we want to play in your mobile phone so that means
that Google and Apple has opened it for extension so that other developers can
add more feature in their mobile phone but the basic functionality is closed for modify application.

->let's say you have already written a class which is working
 fine in production now you get some more feature requests from your product team
 that we want to add some more feature in this class and what you have to do is
 basically add some more functional to new class.Generally  what Junior developers do is they go and edit
 code which was already working in production which brings a risk of introducing potential problem in the
 code which is already working fine in the production so this principle says
 that you shouldn't be touching the code which is already working which is
 already trustworthy and proven in production right if something is working
 properly in production you shouldn't be touching it if you have to add more
 functionality into your class you should be adding it in such a way that it
 should not affect your existing functionality. if you do so then you will
 run your code into the risk of introducing new bugs so according to this principle
 we should be able to add new feature to the class without affecting the old code this is because
 whenever we edit old code we run the
 risk of introducing potential problems so if at all possible we should avoid
 touching the proven and trustworthy meal  production code .
